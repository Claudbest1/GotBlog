        <h2 className='pt-10 pb-5 font-bold'>OUR ORIGIN</h2>
        <p className='leading-normal'>
          From its early beginnings as a blog, GOTBLOGS obsessively profiled startups, broke the biggest news, reported exclusive stories, produced stellar reviews, crafted incisive opinions, and produced a thought-provoking analysis of the technology industry.
          Since its founding in 2008, GOTBLOGS has continued to build on its reputation as the most authoritative news publication covering the technology scene across Africa.
          Little wonder that Forbes described GOTBLOGS back in 2012 as Africa’s most authoritative technology blog. And Samara Lynn, Technology editor for Black Enterprise magazine said the award-winning blog's reputation as the best site covering the African tech scene is well-deserved.
